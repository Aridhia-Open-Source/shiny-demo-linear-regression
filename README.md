# LINEAR REGRESSION

**Linear Regresion** attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It is used to predict the value of the **dependent** (or outcome) variable based on the value of the **independent** (or explanatory) variable. 

Once a regression model has been fit to a group of data, we can examine the **residuals**, which are the deviations from the fitted line to the observed values; this helps on the validation of the model.
